                    Greetings!  My name is <b>DJ</b>, and I am an aspiring software developer working hard to break into the industry.  This website is a collection of my completed projects for curious
                    minds to peruse (as well as a project in itself) so feel free to have a look around.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My current language of choice is Python though I have dabbled in many, and I am currently working to add more projects to this list.
                    If you have any questions about a project or would just like to chat, feel free to send me an email using the <a href="#contact">form</a> below.  Also please head on over and check out my 
                    <a href="https://github.com/djleedke" target="_blank">Github</a> if you would like to check out the code!
